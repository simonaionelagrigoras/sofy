CESA-2009:1076-01 CentOS-2 End Of Life Notification
September 9, 2009


This is the End Of Life notification for CentOS-2.

As per the upstream vendors errata support policy, updates for CentOS-2
ended on May 31, 2009.

CentOS-2 is no longer available for download via the CentOS mirror network.
It can still be obtained from the CentOS vault at:

http://vault.centos.org/2.1/final/

It is recommended that any system still running CentOS 2 should be
upgraded to a more recent version of CentOS to ensure continued security
and bug fix support. Upgrade information can be found here

More details are available from the RedHat web site at:

Thank you to everyone who helped make this project possible. The Caos
and CentOS projects, the unnamed upstream vendor and of course, the
users who gave it a reason to exist.

After 5 years at the helm of CentOS-2, I look forward to working on some
new projects both CentOS and elsewhere. This might be the last update
announcement I post but it won't be the last time you see my name.
